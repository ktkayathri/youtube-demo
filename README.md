# youtube-demo
 Youtube demo project using Bootstrap (HTML and CSS)
 
- Included the Offcanvas for the side toggle navigation bar
- Header and body designed using grids and columns
- Thumbnails of videos included using Cards
- Using Image overlay, included the icons for 'Watch Later' and 'Add to Queue' (Somehow the toiltip works only for one of them)
- Tested with one video
